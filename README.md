### 📘 Repository Description

**Low Dopamine Meds** is a personal, non-medical compilation of information, coping tools, and open-access research related to dopamine regulation issues, ADHD, depression, anhedonia, and similar conditions. This project is especially aimed at neurodivergent individuals and others who, like me, struggle to access adequate and affordable healthcare.

> ⚠️ This repository is not meant to diagnose, treat, or cure any condition. It is simply a knowledge-sharing effort.

### 🧩 Contents include

* 📚 Simple research on papers and studies
* 💊 Notes on common psychiatric medications and their mechanisms
* 🌿 Information on legal non prescription supplements and chemical approaches
* 🤝 Community-sourced coping techniques and routines
* 🧠 Critical perspectives on mainstream psychiatry

I do **not** promote illegal drug use or self-medication. I do **not** offer medical advice.

Everything here is for **educational and harm-reduction purposes** only. Please use your own judgment and consult professionals when possible.

### 🧭 Why this name?

This repo is called **Low Dopamine Meds** to increase its discoverability for folks searching terms like “low dopamine,” “how to boost dopamine,” “dopamine deficiency,” etc. I chose this title intentionally, but the goal is to provide support and autonomy, not a replacement for professional care.
